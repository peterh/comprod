<h1>About Commodity Producers</h1>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>You've decided to become a day trader. You've saved up a nest egg, and
you are going to gamble it on the stock market. In particular, on the
companies that produce commodities.</p>
<h3>Game Play</h3>
<p>Buy and sell board lots (blocks of 100) of the commodity producing
companies listed on the game's market. We're pretending, so your broker
works for free; there are no commissions payable on any trade.</p>
<p>Each day at midnight UTC, the game reflects the market adjustments for
the day. Stock prices go up and down, and stocks doing well (at or above
$100 per share) may even pay dividends.</p>
<p>At the end of each month, a winner is declared and the game is reset.<p>
